A beginner friendly understanding of Data Science process.

# Consider the acronym for data science process: 'BAR CUP MED F'

B- Business Understanding - Come up with questions one wants to answer.

A- Analytical Analysis - Understand what the solution will look like. - classification or predictive or clustering and many more.

R- Requirements - Understand what kind of data points might be needed.


C- Collecting data - Find out sources and collect the required data.

U- Understand data - Do some statistical analysis or some data visualisation to know more about the dataset.

P- Preparing data - Find out if missing data is to be replaced, if feature engineering is needed, make specific data types as per need.


M- Modelling - Understand patterns in the dataset using Machine Learning or Deep Learning on a test data.

E- Evaluating - Run the trained model on the test data and evaluate the model.

D- Deployment - Once a reasonably good model is trained, it is deployed into production. 


F- Feedback - It is a chance to improve the model further based on feedback.
